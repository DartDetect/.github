 - The backend API runs **locally** for model inference and image processing

 ## Setup Instructions

 ### Frontend Setup (React Native App)
 1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DartDetect/dartdetect-cross-platform-app.git
    cd dartdetect-cross-platform-app/dart-detect-app

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/DartDetect/dartboard-backend-api.git
   cd dartboard-backend-api
   ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. To run the backend Server:
    ```bash
   Python app.py
   ```
6. Python path might have to be set:
    ```bash
   $env:PYTHONPATH = "[YOUR_BACKEND_PROJECT_PATH]"
   python backend/app.py
   ```
